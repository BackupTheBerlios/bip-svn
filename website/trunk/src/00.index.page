Bip is an IRC proxy, which means it keeps connected to your preferred IRC
servers, can store the logs for you, and even send them back to your IRC client
upon connection. You may want to use bip to keep your logfiles (in a unique
format and on a unique computer) whatever your client is, when you connect from
multiple workstations, or when you simply want to have a playback of what was
said while you were away.

Bip is developed by Arnaud Cornet and Lo√Øc Gomez and is distributed under the
GNU Public License Version 2 (see the AUTHORS file for a list of contributors).
BIP IRC channel is on OFTC : irc://irc.oftc.net/#bip
